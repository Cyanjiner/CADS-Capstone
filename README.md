## Useful Code Sources:

-   [DTW.Rmd](https://github.com/Cyanjiner/CADS-Capstone/blob/main/DTW.Rmd) contains code for data cleaning, data management, functions of producing excess deaths using ARIMA/GARCH, & implementations of hierarchical clustering analyses on Time Series data based on Euclidean distances and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances.

-   [K-medoids.Rmd](https://github.com/Cyanjiner/CADS-Capstone/blob/main/K-medoids.Rmd) contains code for implementing K-Medoids clustering on mix-typed data with computations of the Gower distance.

Note: you can also set up the environment using [JZ-capstone.Rproj](https://github.com/Cyanjiner/CADS-Capstone/blob/main/JZ-capstone.Rproj) in R.

## Other Materials:

-   [JZ-capstone.pdf](https://github.com/Cyanjiner/CADS-Capstone/blob/main/JZ-capstone.pdf) contains my presentation slides outlining our literature reviews, measures and analytical methods, findings, and recommendations.

-   [JZ_CADS_capstone_spring2022.pdf](https://github.com/Cyanjiner/CADS-Capstone/blob/main/JZ_CADS_capstone_spring2022.pdf) is the final paper of this presented work.
